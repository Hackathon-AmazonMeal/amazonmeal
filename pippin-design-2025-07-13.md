## 3. Development Workflow with GenAI

### 3.1 Project Setup Phase

Use AI tools to accelerate your initial setup:

```
Prompt: "Generate a React application structure for a meal planning app with the following components: user profile, recipe browser, meal planner, and shopping cart."
```

```
Prompt: "Create AWS CDK code to set up the following resources for my AmazonMeal project: Lambda functions for user profile, recipes, recommendations, shopping service, and DynamoDB tables for users, recipes, products, meal plans, and shopping lists."
```

### 3.2 Frontend Development

For your React components:

```
Prompt: "Create a React component for a recipe card that displays: image, title, cooking time, difficulty level, and dietary tags. Use Material UI components and make it responsive."
```

```
Prompt: "Generate a React hook for managing user preferences with the following fields: dietary restrictions, allergies, disliked ingredients, cooking time preference, cuisine preferences, and skill level."
```

### 3.3 Backend Development

For your AWS Lambda functions:

```
Prompt: "Write an AWS Lambda function in JavaScript that queries DynamoDB for recipes matching user preferences. The user preferences include dietary restrictions, cuisines, and maximum cooking time."
```

```
Prompt: "Create a function that converts a meal plan (array of recipes) into a shopping list by extracting and consolidating all required ingredients."
```

### 3.4 AI/ML Development

For recommendation engine implementation:

```
Prompt: "Write a function that ranks recipes based on user preferences with the following scoring logic: +3 points for matching cuisine, -5 points for containing disliked ingredients, +2 points for matching difficulty level to user skill."
```

```
Prompt: "Create a simple recommendation algorithm that filters recipes based on dietary restrictions first, then sorts by user preference score."
```

## 4. Component-Specific Strategies

### 4.1 User Profile Service

```
Prompt: "Generate a Lambda function that handles creating and updating user profiles in DynamoDB. The profile schema includes: userId, username, email, and a preferences object with dietary restrictions, allergies, and cuisine preferences."
```

### 4.2 Recipe Service

```
Prompt: "Write code to seed a DynamoDB table with 20 different recipes. Each recipe should have a unique ID, name, cuisine type, ingredients list, instructions, preparation time, and dietary tags."
```

### 4.3 Recommendation Service

```
Prompt: "Create a function that takes a user's preferences and dietary restrictions and returns a 7-day meal plan with breakfast, lunch, and dinner for each day, ensuring variety in cuisines and meal types."
```

### 4.4 Shopping Service

```
Prompt: "Write a function that takes a list of ingredients from selected recipes and groups them by category (produce, dairy, meat, pantry, etc.) for display in a shopping list."
```

### 4.5 Voice Processing

```
Prompt: "Create a simple voice command processor that can handle the following intents: search recipes, add to shopping list, read recipe steps, and get nutrition information."
```

## 5. Testing and Quality Assurance

```
Prompt: "Generate unit tests for the meal recommendation function that tests edge cases like: user with multiple dietary restrictions, no cuisine preferences specified, and empty recipe database."
```

```
Prompt: "Create integration test scenarios for the flow from meal plan generation to shopping list creation."
```

## Conclusion

This implementation plan focuses on leveraging AWS serverless technologies to rapidly develop the AmazonMeal application. By using managed services like Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Cognito, we minimize infrastructure management and focus on delivering core application features. The phased approach allows us to have a working MVP early while progressively adding more sophisticated features.

The architecture is designed for simplicity and reliability, with clear separation of concerns between services. The serverless approach ensures the application can scale automatically with user demand while keeping costs proportional to actual usage. This design document provides a solid foundation for the team to begin implementation immediately.

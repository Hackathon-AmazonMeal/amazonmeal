# AmazonMeal: High-Level Architecture Design

## 1. Executive Summary

AmazonMeal is an AI-powered meal planning and grocery shopping solution integrating with Amazon Fresh. This innovative system addresses three key customer pain points: decision fatigue in meal planning, nutrition management complexity, and shopping inefficiency. By leveraging Amazon Bedrock for AI/ML capabilities, AWS Lambda for serverless compute, and DynamoDB for data storage, AmazonMeal will create a seamless end-to-end experience from meal discovery to grocery delivery.

This design document outlines the technical architecture for a 3-day hackathon implementation that will demonstrate the core functionality while establishing a foundation that could scale to production. The solution will showcase how AI can transform the grocery shopping experience while increasing customer engagement and order value for Amazon Fresh.

## 2. Strategic Context

### 2.1 Current Limitations

Amazon Fresh customers currently face several challenges in their meal planning and grocery shopping experience:

1. **Disconnected Experience**: Meal planning and grocery shopping exist as separate processes, forcing customers to manually translate recipes into shopping lists
2. **Decision Overload**: Customers struggle with the paradox of choice when facing thousands of product options
3. **Personalization Gap**: Current recommendations lack deep personalization based on dietary needs, preferences, and past behavior
4. **Time Inefficiency**: The process of planning meals, creating shopping lists, and ordering groceries is time-consuming and repetitive

### 2.2 Business Drivers

1. **Customer Engagement**: Increase frequency and duration of Amazon Fresh platform usage
2. **Order Value**: Boost average order size through complete meal solutions rather than individual items
3. **Customer Retention**: Improve loyalty by solving real customer problems and creating habits
4. **Competitive Advantage**: Differentiate Amazon Fresh from other grocery delivery services

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 System Overview

AmazonMeal adopts a modern serverless architecture built on AWS services. The system consists of four primary components:

1. **User Engagement Layer**: React-based frontend application handling user interactions and display
2. **API Services Layer**: Lambda-based serverless functions exposed through API Gateway
3. **AI/ML Processing Layer**: Bedrock-powered recommendation and personalization engine
4. **Data Storage Layer**: DynamoDB tables for user profiles, recipes, and product catalog

These layers work together to deliver a cohesive user experience while maintaining separation of concerns for modularity and scalability.

### 3.2 Core Components

#### 3.2.1 Frontend Application

The frontend application will be built using React with Material UI components. Key aspects include:

* **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile experiences
* **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: For potential offline functionality in future iterations
* **State Management**: Using React Context API for state management across components
* **API Integration**: Axios for RESTful API calls to backend services

The frontend will feature:
- User profile and preference management
- Meal discovery and browsing interface
- Meal plan visualization and calendar
- Shopping list management
- Voice command simulation interface

#### 3.2.2 API Services

The backend services will be implemented as AWS Lambda functions exposed through Amazon API Gateway. These stateless services will provide:

* **User Profile Service**: Manages user accounts and preferences
* **Recipe Service**: Handles recipe storage, retrieval, and metadata
* **Recommendation Service**: Processes user data to generate personalized recommendations
* **Shopping Service**: Manages shopping lists and cart integration

Using Lambda provides advantages for the hackathon:
- Quick deployment without infrastructure setup
- Pay-per-use model ideal for demo scenarios
- Automatic scaling for presentation scenarios
- Native integration with other AWS services

#### 3.2.3 AI/ML Engine

The AI/ML engine using Amazon Bedrock will serve as the intelligent core of AmazonMeal, providing:

* **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggest recipes based on user preferences and history
* **Ingredient Substitution**: Recommend alternative products when first choice is unavailable
* **Nutritional Analysis**: Analyze meal plans for nutritional balance
* **Voice Processing**: Basic voice command recognition and processing

For the hackathon, we'll implement a simplified AI approach using:
- Rule-based filtering for initial recommendations
- Amazon Bedrock for natural language processing of user preferences
- Pre-defined substitution rules for common ingredients

#### 3.2.4 Data Storage

AmazonMeal will use Amazon DynamoDB as its primary data store, with the following key tables:

* **Users Table**: Stores user profiles, preferences, and authentication data
* **Recipes Table**: Contains recipe information, ingredients, and instructions
* **Products Table**: Mock catalog of Amazon Fresh products
* **MealPlans Table**: Stores generated meal plans and their association with users
* **ShoppingLists Table**: Maintains shopping lists derived from meal plans

DynamoDB offers several advantages for this use case:
- Flexible schema for evolving data models
- High-performance for read-heavy workloads
- Seamless scaling for growing data sets
- Native AWS integration

### 3.3 Integration Points

#### 3.3.1 Mock Authentication

The system will implement simplified mock authentication for the hackathon demo:
- JWT-based token authentication
- Pre-defined demo users with different preference profiles
- Session management via frontend state

#### 3.3.2 Amazon Fresh Integration

While actual integration with Amazon Fresh is beyond the scope of the hackathon, we will simulate this integration by:
- Creating a mock product catalog resembling Amazon Fresh offerings
- Implementing simulated cart functionality
- Demonstrating how actual integration points would work in production

### 3.4 Data Flow

1. **User Profile Creation**:
   - User inputs preferences and dietary restrictions
   - Data is stored in Users table
   - Preference data is processed by the recommendation engine

2. **Meal Plan Generation**:
   - User requests meal plan
   - Recommendation service queries recipe database
   - AI engine filters and ranks recipes based on user preferences
   - Personalized meal plan is returned and stored

3. **Shopping List Creation**:
   - System extracts ingredients from selected recipes
   - Ingredients are mapped to product catalog items
   - Shopping list is generated and stored
   - User can modify list before checkout

4. **Cart Integration**:
   - User confirms shopping list
   - Items are added to simulated Amazon Fresh cart
   - Order is prepared for checkout (simulated)
